Final Project for EECS 769 - Data Science @ KU. Beta538

# Project Proposal

Project: We want to look at the 2016 Presidential election.

Business Problem: How to predict a winner?

Data Sets: We have data from a variety of sources, including some historical data on election outcomes by congressional district, data on campaign tweets and some sentiment analysis, and data on some polling/demographic characteristics.

Approaches/Categories: We think we can look at some algorithms, especially time series with the historical data, that can help predict the outcome of the election. We will also do some data mining with the text from the tweets to add robustness to the predictions.

Specific approaches might include:

Classification for whether a district should be Democratic/Republican
ARMA for historic data
Regression for polling
Perhaps a random forest with decision trees about tweets, sensitivity, and polls?
End Goal: Predict the winner of the election.
